The lifecycle of machine learning project development encompasses a set of roles, stacks of software frameworks and multiple types of computing resources. Such complexity makes MLOps support usually bundled with commercial cloud platforms that is referred as vendor lock. In this paper, we provide an alternative solution that devises a MLOps platform with open source frameworks on any virtual resources. Our MLOps approach is driven by the development roles of machine learning models. The tool chain of our MLOps connects to the typical CI/CD workflow of machine learning applications. We demonstrate a working example of training and deploying a machine learning model for the application of detecting software repository code vulnerability.}

However, many current AI systems are found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection. These shortcomings degrade user experience and erode people’s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we provide AI practitioners with a comprehensive guide for building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, and accountability. To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for a paradigm shift toward comprehensively trustworthy AI systems.},

    abstract = {Developing an annual and global high-resolution land cover map is one of the most ambitious tasks in remote sensing, with increasing importance due to the continual rise in validated data and satellite imagery. The success of land cover classification models largely hinges on the data quality, coupled with the application of Big Data techniques and distributed computing. This is essential for efficiently processing the extensive volume of available satellite data. However, maintaining the lifecycle of several annual Machine Learning models presents a complex challenge. The rise of Machine Learning Operations offers an opportunity to automate the maintenance of these models, a feature particularly beneficial in systems that require generating new models each year alongside the continuous integration of validated data. This article details the development of an end-to-end MLOps workflow, meticulously integrating land cover classification models that employ Big Data strategies for processing large-scale, high-resolution spatial data. The workflow is designed within a Kubernetes environment, achieving on-demand auto-scaling, distributed computing, and load balancing. This integration demonstrates the practicality and efficiency of managing and deploying models that treat satellite imagery in an automated, scalable framework, thus marking a significant advancement in remote sensing and MLOps.}

This paper proposes a new distributed architecture adapted for deploying and updating SL models under the MLOps framework, implemented twofold. First, we structure the core components as microservices deployed on a container orchestration environment, ensuring low computational overhead and high scalability. Second, we propose a periodic model versioning strategy that facilitates seamless updates of SL models without degrading system accuracy. By leveraging the inherent characteristics of SL algorithms, we trigger the model versioning task only when their decision boundaries undergo significant adjustments. This allows our architecture to support scalable inference while handling incremental SL updates, enabling high throughput and model accuracy in production settings. Experiments conducted on a proposal’s prototype implemented as a distributed microservice architecture on Kubernetes attested to our scheme’s feasibility. Our architecture can scale inference throughput as needed, delivering updated SL models in less than 2.5 s, supporting up to 8 inference endpoints while maintaining accuracy similar to traditional single-endpoint setups.}

However, persistent challenges, such as inefficiencies in data integration, delivery, and governance, limit its potential impact. These obstacles hamper the seamless implementation of DataOps strategies, slowing down operational processes and affecting organizational performance in data-driven environments. To address these issues, this research employs a systematic literature review, analyzing contributions from 2004 to 2024, to identify relevant solutions and innovations. The study highlights the value of frameworks, methodologies, and advanced technologies—such as automation, cloud platforms, and continuous delivery pipelines—that have reshaped the DataOps landscape. These contributions guide enterprises toward best practices in data strategy and foster improved collaboration across business and IT teams. Building on this analysis, our research also proposes a personal framework designed to offer a comprehensive approach to DataOps strategy. This framework integrates key insights from existing research and provides practical recommendations and best practices to streamline workflows, enhance data governance, and align IT operations with business goals. The enhanced DataOps practices derived from our framework demonstrate significant potential to boost operational efficiency, accelerate decision-making processes, and unlock new growth opportunities. Furthermore, the implementation of such practices sets the foundation for future innovations in data management and offers a path forward for organizations seeking sustainable, long-term value.}
