\section*{Abstract}
Machine learning projects face significant deployment challenges, with only a small percentage successfully reaching production due to operational complexity.
This thesis addresses these challenges by developing and implementing a state-of-the-art MLOps-GitOps workflow designed to support machine learning projects from initiation through production maturity.
Following a comprehensive literature review of current MLOps methodologies and frameworks, we implement a modular workflow using a two-phase approach: initial validation with a controlled demonstration model, followed by application to the real-world LSFB (Langue des Signes de Belgique Francophone) production system.
The implementation integrates enterprise-level technologies including Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, Airflow, and Kubeflow pipelines, applying GitOps methodology consistently across DataOps and MLOps processes.
The resulting workflow successfully demonstrates how a state-of-the-art MLOps-GitOps approach can bootstrap machine learning projects and support their progression toward greater maturity, providing a reusable foundation for diverse data engineering and machine learning projects across various organizational scales.
