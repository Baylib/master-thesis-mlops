I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all those who contributed to the successful completion of this thesis.
First and foremost, I extend my deepest appreciation to my thesis promoters Benoit Frenay and JÃ©rome Fink for their invaluable guidance, continuous support, and expertise throughout this research project.
Their insights into Machine Learning Develpment and practical feedback were instrumental in shaping the direction and quality of this work.
I am grateful to the team behind the LSFB (Langue des Signes de Belgique Francophone) project for providing access to their dataset.
Their collaboration was essential in demonstrating the real-world applicability of our MLOps-GitOps workflow, and their domain expertise greatly enriched the practical validation of our implementation.
Special thanks to my fellow students and peers who provided valuable feedback during the development process, particularly regarding the integration of GitOps methodology with our MLOps workflow.
Their suggestions and collaborative discussions helped refine our approach and improve the overall solution.
Finally, I am grateful to my family and friends for their support throughout my master's program.
This research would not have been possible without them.
