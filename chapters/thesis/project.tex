\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Building upon our state-of-the-art review of MLOps practices, this chapter introduces our practical implementation of a MLOps/GitOps workflow.
The proposed workflow is designed with versatility in mindâ€”capable of enhancing existing projects at various maturity levels or providing a robust foundation for new initiatives seeking accelerated production deployment.

Rather than developing yet another platform, our approach integrates established tools and workflows identified in the literature into a cohesive system tailored to address modern machine learning development challenges.
A distinguishing feature of our implementation is the incorporation of GitOps principles into the MLOps workflow, creating a synergistic relationship between these complementary methodologies.

At the core of our design is the GitOps philosophy, which establishes Git repositories as the single source of truth for code, configurations, and infrastructure.
We leverage GitHub repositories as the central foundation, with GitHub Actions orchestrating our DevOps workflows.
This integration extends further through tools such as ArgoCD, GitSync, and custom scripts that trigger our DataOps and MLOps pipelines. % in a synchronized manner.

Our infrastructure is deployable across one or multiple Kubernetes clusters, depending on specific project requirements.
This architecture decouples the workflow definition from hardware considerations, offering significant flexibility.
The Kubernetes implementation supports dedicated nodes with specialized resources (high CPU, memory, GPU) for compute-intensive machine learning or data processing operations.
Furthermore, this approach accommodates diverse deployment scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
\item Cloud-based Kubernetes clusters
\item On-premises infrastructure
\item Single-node Kubernetes configurations running on development laptops (within hardware constraints)
\end{itemize}

The seamless integration of DevOps, DataOps, and MLOps pipelines culminates in a comprehensive MLOps workflow that is portable across any Kubernetes environment.
This integration addresses the full machine learning lifecycle from development to deployment while maintaining consistent practices. % throughout.

Our implementation was specifically developed to support our promoter's ongoing LSFB (Langue des Signes de Belgique Francophone) project, which is already operational in a production environment.
The practical application of our workflow to an existing, real-world machine learning system provided valuable insights into the challenges of MLOps adoption beyond theoretical constructs.
By enhancing the established LSFB project infrastructure, we could demonstrate the adaptability and incremental benefits of our approach while supporting continued model development and improvement for this important initiative.

In the following sections, we detail our use cases and the specific tools selected to implement our workflow and explain how they interconnect to create a modular system that can adapt as projects evolve in complexity and maturity.
Notably, our tool selection was significantly influenced by the existing LSFB project infrastructure.
The current production system consists of a Python-based model deployed as a Docker image that exposes an API consumed by a web frontend.
The project already utilizes GitHub for code management and Airflow for certain pipeline operations, which represents partial implementation of practices identified in our literature review.
These existing elements served as foundational components that our comprehensive workflow needed to accommodate and enhance rather than replace, demonstrating the practical flexibility of our approach.
