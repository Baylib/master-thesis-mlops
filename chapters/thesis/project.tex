\chaptermark{Thesis : MLOps WorkFlow}
\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Following our state-of-the-art research we wanted to describe and implement a standard MLOps workflow.
I should be easily used on current project to improve their level of maturity or to initiate a new project with a solid
base to be fast in production.

We don't want to create a platform, but we want to use and integrate together reviewed
tools and workflows we encountered in the literature to propose our own.

\section{Tools}\label{sec:tools2}
In this section we will list all the tools we picked from our previous research.
As our workflow should be standard it should remain tools agnostic.

\subsection{Git Repositories and CI/CD}\label{subsec:github}
GitHub will be used to store and version control our codes repositories and configurations.
It will also be used to implement our CI/CD pipelines with GitHub actions.

\subsection{IAC, Containers and Registry}\label{subsec:dockerhub}
To benefit from containerization we will use docker to containerize our applications and models.
DockerHub will be used to store and version our Docker containers and Helm charts.

\subsection{Kubernetes}\label{subsec:kubernetes}
We will use a kubernetes cluster to benefit from its orchestration and deployment strategies and the other tools available
on kubenrets

\subsection{Airflow}\label{subsec:airflow}
We will use Airflow for our DataOps pipelines and to integrate our kubeflow pipelines.
We can use an Airflow DAG to trigger our Kubeflow pipelines and have a complete DataOps/MLOps pipeline while still allow respective teams
to benefit from other tools.

\subsection{Kubeflow}\label{subsec:kubeflow}
We will mainly use the storage solutions and pipelines offered by Kubeflow.
But by using kubeflow pipelines we could easily add features during the development.

\subsection{ArgoCD}\label{subsec:argocd}
ArgoCD will be used to implement our GitOps strategy and deploy our application, models, airflow and kubeflow.

\section{Workflow}\label{sec:workflow}
As we explained while describing the infrastructure, part of our global workflow can be implemented within pipelines runners definition.
We used GitHub action and the GitHub flow to harmonise the workflow within our different type of git repositories.
GitHub allows us to define template in a single repository that can be then versioned and used in other repositories while hiding the complexity of the defined pipelines.



\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Airflow pipelines and kubeflow pipelines to easily integrate DataOps and MLOps pipelines together to reach more automation as the project gains maturity.
