\section{Tools and Frameworks}\label{sec:tools}

In this section we will present some of the tools that the literature recommend to implement a MLops workflow.

\subsection{Docker}
But storing this metadata is not enough. Deploying to production should automati‐
cally and reliably rebuild this environment on the target machine. In addition, the
target machine will typically run multiple models simultaneously, and two models
may have incompatible dependency versions. Finally, several models running on the
same machine could compete for resources, and one misbehaving model could hurt
the performance of multiple cohosted models.
Containerization technology is increasingly used to tackle these challenges. These
tools bundle an application together with all of its related configuration files, libraries,
and dependencies that are required for it to run across different operating environ‐
ments. Unlike virtual machines (VMs), containers do not duplicate the complete
operating system; multiple containers share a common operating system and are
therefore far more resource efficient.
The most well-known containerization technology is the open source platform
Docker. Released in 2014, it has become the de facto standard. It allows an application
to be packaged, sent to a server (the Docker host), and run with all its dependencies
in isolation from other applications.\cite{treveil2020introducing}(p.80)

\subsection{Kubernetes}

Docker with Kubernetes can provide a powerful infrastructure to host applications,
including ML models. Leveraging these products greatly simplifies the implementa‐
tion of the deployment strategies—like blue-green deployments or canary releases—
although they are not aware of the nature of the deployed applications and thus can’t
natively manage the ML performance analysis. Another major advantage of this type
of infrastructure is the ability to easily scale the model’s deployment.\cite{treveil2020introducing}(p.81)
