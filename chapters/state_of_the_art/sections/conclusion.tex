\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:stconclusion}

During our research and thanks to the survey we conducted we gain enough knowledge and confidence that our project was indeed of some usage.

As shown and stated in our results we can design an MLOps workflow thanks to already existing literature and tools.
But we didn't find any complete standard workflow that reunite Devops CI/CD pipelines and MLOps pipelines using traditional Git Branching strategies.
We'll try in our project to implement a standard MLOps workflow using state-of-the-art frameworks and tools.
