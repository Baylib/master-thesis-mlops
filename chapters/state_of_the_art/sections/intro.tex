\section{Introduction}\label{sec:stintro}

This chapter lays the groundwork for our implementation by exploring the current landscape of MLOps practices, identifying key challenges in machine learning development, and criteria for implementing an effective MLOps workflows.
Through this review, we aim to bridge theoretical understanding with practical application, ultimately contributing to more reliable, efficient, and maintainable machine learning systems in production environments.

Having established the context and objectives of our research, we will now define the fundamental concepts that underpin MLOps.
By establishing this common vocabulary, we aim to make our analysis and subsequent implementation accessible to a wider technical audience.
It requires only a prior general knowledge about machine learning, software development, or data engineering.
