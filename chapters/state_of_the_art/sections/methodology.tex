\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodo}
\subsection{Literature review (LR)}

We conducted a Literature Review in order to refine our research questions and find the key concepts and gaps in MlOps Workflows.
We proceeded as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define our research questions
    \item Define articles inclusion and exclusion criteria
    \item Refine our set of keywords
    \item Querying publications search engines with our keywords
    \item Forward tracking and Back tracking
\end{enumerate}

We used this method because it is the \textit{de facto} approach to control biases and draws conclusions that stay partial due to
a non-complete coverage of the existing literature.

\subsection{Research questions}

We first defined several research questions and then refined the one that we deemed the most relevant.
Our first set of questions were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the particularities of an MLops workflow compared to a classic DevOps CI/CD workflow?
    \item What are the new requirements and challenges in MlOps?
    \item Are there/What are already mature tools to help development teams create pipelines for their ML projects
    \item What limitations of those tools can be identified?
\end{itemize}

Our final research question is
\textit{"How to implement/propose a state-of-the-art standard MlOps workflows that could be used from level 1 to 3"} (|cite| text with levels)
